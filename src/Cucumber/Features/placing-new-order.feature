Feature: Placing new order

Scenario: Placing a new order for Hummingbird Printed Sweater

  Given I'm on the "https://mystore-testlab.coderslab.pl" page
  When I log in using email "hhunbhpyknwhgwmqkq@tcwlx.com" and password "12345"
  And I go to the Clothes product list page
  And I see that Hummingbird Printed Sweater is 20% discounted
  Then I add 5 units of size "M" to my basket
  When I proceed to checkout
  And I confirm my address
  And I choose PrestaShop pick up in store delivery method
  And I choose Pay by Check payment method
  And I check the term of service checkbox
  And I place an order
  Then I can see "YOUR ORDER IS CONFIRMED" message
  And I make a screenshot of the order confirmation page
  And I go to the Order history and details page
  And I see that my order has "Awaiting check payment" status
  And I see that my order's total price is the same as on the order confirmation page
  And I close my browser
